Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated! Every
little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

You can contribute in many ways:

Types of Contributions
----------------------

Report Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~

Report bugs at https://github.com/twosigma/marbles/issues.

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

* Your operating system name and version.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
* Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

The `issue template <https://github.com/twosigma/marbles/issues/new>`__ will
tell you how to collect version information.

Fix Bugs
~~~~~~~~

Look through the `GitHub issues <https://github.com/twosigma/marbles/issues>`__
for bugs. Anything tagged with "bug" and "help wanted" is open to whoever wants
to implement it.

Implement Features
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look through the `GitHub issues <https://github.com/twosigma/marbles/issues>`__
for features. Anything tagged with "enhancement" and "help wanted" is open to
whoever wants to implement it.

Write Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

marbles could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official marbles docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

Submit Feedback
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at
https://github.com/twosigma/marbles/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

* Explain in detail how it would work.
* Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.

Build a Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We've developed marbles in a pluggable way, so you can contribute to the marbles
ecosystem without committing code to the marbles repo!

Just as marbles provides some mixins you can add to a :class:`unittest.TestCase`
by adding a superclass to your test, you can develop more mixins outside the
marbles repo and publish them yourself, they'll interoperate just fine. Of
course, we'd like to include mixins which may be useful to many people in the
:mod:`marbles.mixins` package, so if you think that's the case, please send us a
pull request.

The marbles annotation logging mechanism right now just writes JSON structured
data to a file. You can use ``logstash``, ``mongoimport``, ``Spark``, or any
other tool that understands JSON to store and analyze them after the fact. But,
you can also implement the marbles logging interface to do something else with
the assertion metadata, instead of logging it to disk. If you'd like to share
your logging plugin, or discuss ideas for how to build one, just open an issue
and we can discuss it with you there.

Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up marbles for local development.

1. Fork the marbles repo on GitHub `here
   <https://github.com/twosigma/marbles/fork>`__.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/marbles.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. If you have `pipenv
   <https://docs.pipenv.org/>`_ installed, you can run::

    $ cd marbles/
    $ pipenv install --dev
    $ pipenv shell

   This will install all of the ``marbles`` development dependencies,
   install ``marbles`` in development mode, so your changes to the
   files in your clone will take effect immediately, and put you in a
   shell where you can run the tests, build the docs, etc.

   If you don't use `pipenv`_, you can get the same effect inside any
   other virtualenv by running::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature-or-docs

   Now you can make your changes locally. ``marbles`` is developed as separate
   packages in the namespace package ``marbles``:

   1. The :class:`~unittest.TestCase` customizations and the assertion logging
      infrastructure live in :mod:`marbles.core`, which you'll find inside the
      repo under :file:`marbles/core`.
   2. The mixins live in :mod:`marbles.mixins`, which you'll find inside the
      repo under :file:`marbles/mixins`.

5. As you make changes, you can run the tests and lint with
   flake8. These should be run inside the package you've made changes
   to, so if you've made changes to :mod:`marbles.core`, you should
   run this::

    $ cd marbles/core
    $ python setup.py flake8
    $ python setup.py test

   .. note:: Don't worry about bumping version numbers yourself. We'll
             handle this in the release that includes your changes.

   If you want to run the full set of linting, testing, and coverage
   measurement that will be done in CI, you can use `tox
   <https://tox.readthedocs.io>`_. With no arguments, it runs
   everything, with ``-e`` you can select a subset::

    $ tox
    $ tox -e coverage,flake8,docs

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

8. We'll review your changes, merge them, and include them in the next
   release.

Pull Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Make sure
   your new functionality is documented with docstrings and appropriate
   additions to the Sphinx docs, and add the feature to the list in README.md.
3. The pull request should work for Python 2.7, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6, and for
   PyPy. Check https://travis-ci.org/twosigma/marbles/pull_requests and make
   sure that the tests pass for all supported Python versions.
4. In order to accept your code contributions, please fill out the appropriate
   Contributor License Agreement in the `cla folder
   <https://github.com/twosigma/marbles/tree/master/cla>`__ and submit it to
   tsos@twosigma.com. We need this before we can accept your pull request.
